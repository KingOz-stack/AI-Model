# AI-Model
AI Model for Analyzing the Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture
This project builds an AI model to assess the effects of climate change on agriculture using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, and the project is implemented in Python using Google Colab. The goal is to predict agricultural trends based on climate variables.

Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between climate change and its impact on agricultural productivity. By applying machine learning algorithms, the model attempts to provide insights into how different climate factors affect crop yields and other agricultural indicators.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas
Model building using Scikit-learn
Analyzed climate and agriculture-related data
Accuracy testing and performance metrics
Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle. It contains data related to climate variables (temperature, precipitation, etc.) and agricultural outputs (crop yields, production, etc.).

Tools and Libraries
Google Colab: Used for coding and cloud-based execution.
Pandas: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: This is used to build the machine learning model and evaluate its performance.
